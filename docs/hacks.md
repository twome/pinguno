List of hacks, jury-rigs, workarounds, and other solutions that we should try to improve for readability/performance/stability/security.

- Not properly using PingsLog type for JSON logs (I think)
- Different names for targetLists between Pingu types and everything else 
- Many functions do not properly check input type/validity
