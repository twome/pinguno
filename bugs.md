# Bug list

## Listing bugs here in lieu of a proper bug tracker, so this is portable to different repo/project systems

- after running for long enough on native ping, we stop getting "new" pings (newer than the active log file's) for some reason

- BUG: getting duplicates in saved ping list
	- annoying but not inaccurate for manual inspection until we get to processing/averaging etc the data
